description: A routine that kept me sane was visiting that Windy Hill

Sometimes I really wanted to escape from the stress of courses and research, and
even trying to learn about myself. I decided that at the end of every quarter,
I would go to the Windy Hill. Somehow standing at the top with my hair
flying around like a raggamuffin, I felt like the wind would blow away all
the crap. Whenever I was struggling in the middle of the quarter, I'd always
think forward to that future moment, and know that soon enough I'd be there.
